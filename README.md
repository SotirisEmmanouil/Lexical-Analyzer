## Performs a Lexical Analysis on a Pascal source code file

This project lexically analyzes a Pascal source code file by taking Pascal lexemes and assigning them to their corresponding token. For example, 
if the `(*` lexeme appears, the token code `COMMENT` will be assigned to it or if the lexeme `THEN` appears, the token code `THENSYM` will be 
assigned to it. The `main` method prints out a side by side comparison of each lexeme and its corresponding token.
